Title: Welcome to Oran
---

Welcome adventurer, to The Lands of Oran.
I thank you for making the journey with me, and hope this letter finds you well and bustling with exitement over the prospect of new adventure!
Three years ago, I received a magical message, a plea for help, from a being unbeknowst to me.  As you might know I had recently retiered, but that life is dull, and I was itching for something to do. Thus, when I got this shot at a final great adventure into the unknown with hundreds of brave souls at my side, I jumped at the opportunity. I care not from where you come, or why you decided to leave your homeland to travel with me. We have come to explore, to help, to find great treasure, and most of all, discover what great mystery lies behind this cryptic distress signal.

Three years ago I recieved this message, and only just now are we arriving, but that is not without reason. Finding adventurers willing to leave all they know and travel seeking danger and mystery is, as you might have guessed, not that hard, but know that for an operation of this size we also need merchants, smiths, medical personel, sailors, and all you other folk who are not used to risking life and limb in the name of adventure. I cannot express my gratitude, but I can damn well try. Thank you to every single one of you (yes, even you Steve). Especially gratefull am I to [[Philip Ravenloft]], our doctor and head of medicine, [[Tyrelle Elynnoor]], leader of the trade and craftspeople and [[Bik Yven]], the captain of my ship. Without you three this operation would never have happened.

Now, with all of the formality done away with, welcome to [[Camp Tranquil]] (though I still don't like the name). You might be suprised at what you see here, but I'll explain why this city is built like it is. The waters around us are constantly rising, at varying rates. Because of this anything built on land is bound to get drowned sooner or later, and so the greatest minds (yours truly very much not included) of our conglomerate came up with this plan, to strap, nail and in any other way build all of our ships together to create one giant floating amalgamation we can call home. We started out small, with me and [[Bik Yven|Bik]] combining our ship with [[Philip Ravenloft|Philip's]] medical ship and [[Tyrelle Elynnoor|Tyrelle's]] trading vessel, to create what is now the core of our city. As more and more adventuring ships arrived (of which there are still many to come), they have attached themselves, creating our sprawling home. Of course not every ship has been attached in this way, we still need to get around to the different islands, but a large majority of them are, and as you are reading this [[Tyrelle Elynnoor|Tyrelle]] have put the woodworkers and shipbuilders hard to work, creating both new vessels, and expansions of our little home.

So, what do we know of the world then?
Well, I'm going to be perfectly honest. So far we don't have a lot. [[Yggdrasill|The giant tree]] off in the South East certainly requires investigating, as does the pale and laughably short "[[Whitetop|mountain]]" straight East from where we are at the moment. There are a few smaller islands around as well of course, covered in woodlands or grasslands, then finally there is the giant desert. We very recently sent out some scouting parties, but they aren't set to arrive back for another few days. Once they do however, that is where you come in. We will need you to investigate what the scouts have found, find, interact and help the local population, and our end goal would be to figure out why the water is rising so sporadically (the distress message I got spoke about rapidly rising water, and so I'm assuming Oran didn't always look this blue).

That is all from me, at least for now! I hope you're getting settled in [[Camp Tranquil]], and that you're getting to know your peers. Sooner or later you'll have to trust them with your life.

All the best
\- [[Astrid]]
