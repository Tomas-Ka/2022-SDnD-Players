Title: Oran

### The world of Oran
What was once The Lands of Oran is now a dying archeapelago. The water level seems to have risen very quickly, as you can still see grass frowing under the sea level on some islands. Not a lot of exploration has been done so far. Some of the most notable locations are [[Yggdrasill|a giant tree]], a quite short [[Whitetop|mountain]] that at some point must have been very grand, a giant desert island, as well as some smaller locations scattered around, covered in either woodlands, grasslands or both.
