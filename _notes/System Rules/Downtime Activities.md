Title: Downtime Activities

### Pit fighting

Other ways of gaining wealth in between adventures involve using the characters fighting ability and physical performance. Pit fighting is ruled as in Xanathers guide to everything.

  

### Running a business 

Sometimes adventurers life is not just about killing rats in taverns or fighting gods.

The rules for running a business are the same as in the Dungeon masters guide but with the following changes:
- The cost of opening a business is 100gp 
- Instead of the bonus to the check being equal to the number of downtime days worked, the bonus is either the player's charisma(deception), Charisma(persuasion) or the players intelligence + the players tool profisiensi
- The cost for running a business is 20gp and is to be payed at the end of every downtime even if the player has spent their downtime on something else.
- At the end of a downtime, used or not they still roll the d100 and collect payment or pay the appropriate amount of maintenance cost.
- In order to keep things running smoothly  the player can to use their downtime maintaining the store. If the player uses ther downtime maintaining the store they gain an additional bonus to the check equal to the player's level and if the store makes money the gold earned is increased by 50%
- A player cannot have more than one business in his/her possession (we are playing Dungeons and dragons. Not dungeons and monopoly).**

### Research 
Sometimes knowledge is the way towards victory. During a downtime the player can Collect information by studying books and maps or bribing and persuading others. Once all the information has been gathered the player can better anticipate the battles of the coming quest.

The cost of researching starts at 60 gp and at the end of the downtime the player is given clues based on an intelligence (investigation check) shown in the table below. For every 10 gp the player gains an additional +1 to the check for a maximum of +10.

### Buy magic items
Expensive and rare, magic items are sold and bought only rarely, and at high prices. A character that wishes to buy a magic item can do so in a downtime slot according to the rules in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything. 

### Selling magic items
Some items can be less than satisfactory and others are just not needed. A Player can therefore choose to sell the item. The rules for selling a magic item are described in Xanathers guide to everything with the following change.


### Crafting magic items
A character can during a downtime choose to craft powerful magic items of their own. Undergoing a long and expensive task that can require several adventurers. The rules for crafting are the same as in Xanathars guide to everything with the following change.

#### The time and gold required for crafting magical items are as follows
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Rarity</th>
		<th>Number of Downtime Slots</th>
		<th>Gold Cost</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Common</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td> 50 gp</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Uncommon</td>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>200 gp</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Rare</td>
		<td>5</td>
		<td>2000 gp</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Very Rare</td>
		<td>7</td>
		<td>20 000 gp</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Legendary</td>
		<td>10</td>
		<td>100 000 gp</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Crafting healing potions
Potions of healing are special, in that they don’t require nearly as much effort or money to craft. A character who has proficiency with the herbalism kit or alchemist’s tools can create these potions. The costs for doing so are summarised on the Potion of Healing Creation table.

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Potion of Healing</th>
		<th>Cost</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Healing</td>
		<td>25 gp</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Greater Healing</td>
		<td>100 gp</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Superior Healing</td>
		<td>1000 gp </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Supreme Healing</td>
		<td>10 000 gp</td>
	</tr>
</table>

A character can create two potions in a single downtime slot, so long as they succeed on a Wisdom or Intelligence Check (player’s choice), adding their proficiency bonus to the roll due to their proficiency with the tools. On a successful roll of 15 or higher, two potions are successfully created. On a failure, only one potion is created, and the character must expend half of the lost potion’s cost as extra gp to account for the wasted ingredients. 


### Religious Service:
A spiritually inclined character might wish to reconnect with their worship between adventures, and can gain otherworldly blessings by doing so. Performing religious service includes proselytizing, partaking in rituals, or otherwise performing service to a temple. Doing this downtime activity takes your downtime slot, but incurs no monetary cost.
The character makes an Intelligence (religion) check, a Charisma (persuasion) check, or a Wisdom check, then consults the table below. Once you’ve successfully rolled on the spiritual guidance table, you can’t attempt this activity again until your character has gone on a quest.
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Roll 1d4:</th>
		<th>Blessing Received:</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>A surge of inspiration comes upon you. You gain inspiration, as detailed in the player’s handbook.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>You receive 1d6x10 gp in tithes or gifts.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>A divine force grants you temporary favour.
		During the next quest, your character can cast a cantrip of your choice at will, and cast a 1st-level spell of their choice once, without expending a spell slot. Both these spells must be from the cleric spell list, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>A blessing of protection keeps you safe from harm. Once on the next quest, when you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to succeed instead.</td>
	</tr>
</table>



### Elemental Service:
A character can spend their downtime devoting themselves to the elements, rather than a divine being. This works the same as normal religious service, but rather than rolling on the spiritual guidance table, you roll on the elemental guidance table.
<table>
	<tr>
			<th>Roll 1d4:</th>
			<th>Blessing Received:</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>A surge of inspiration comes upon you. You gain inspiration, as detailed in the player’s handbook.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>You receive 1d6x10 gp in tithes or gifts.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>A divine force grants you temporary favour.
			During the next quest, your character can cast a cantrip of your choice at will, and cast a 1st-level spell of their choice once, without expending a spell slot. Both these spells must be from the cleric spell list, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>4</td>
			<td>A blessing of protection keeps you safe from harm. Once on the next quest, when you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to succeed instead.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Carousing:
RNGsus, take the wheel! Spending your downtime slot here leaves fate to lady luck and Randy Random. Your character spends a truly offensive amount of money partying, socialising. 2d6x10 gp, to be exact. If you can’t pay the cost rolled, the activity proceeds, but it is incurred as debt and is detracted from your future quest earnings until it is repaid. Once done, a DM rolls on a very, very stupid table we’ve spent way too much brainpower crafting. The results on it can be good, bad, both, or neither. Only the dice know what fate will befall your poor character.
