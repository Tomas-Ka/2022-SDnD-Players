Title: Character creation rules
---

### Races and classes
Classes, subclasses & Races from the following books are allowed. 
-   Volo's guide to monsters 
-   Players hand book
-   Xanathars guide to everything 
-   Mordenkainen's Tomb of foes
-   Taschas Cauldren of everything
-   Fizbans treasury of dragons
-   Monsters of the multiverse
-   Eberron rising from the last war
-   Guildmaster guide to ravnica

If the class or race has been changed in a later book the newest version is used. Additionally any homebrew(races/classes not made by wizards of the coast) is not allowed, and neither is UA (playtest material)

### Feats:  
The player gains a free feat at level one. Quick link for feats: [https://5e.tools/feats.html#aberrant%20dragonmark_erlw](https://5e.tools/feats.html#aberrant%20dragonmark_erlw) 
Note: some feats have prerequisites that must be meet to obtain the feat.

  

### Point buy:
The system design designed for determining the ability score is a modified version of point buy. The lowest it can go is 7, all scores start at 8 and the player has 27 points to use. (see the image)

How to create a character?
-   Pick race
-   Pick class
-   Pick ability score
-   Choose background
-   Choose equipment
Most of these steps can be done in any order, and many of the steps depend on each other, so you will have to go back and forth a bit.
  

In this example we will create Gandalf from lord of the rings
**Race**
When creating Gandalf we pick the human race. Because of this decision he gains a few bonuses that affects later parts of the creation.

**Class**
For the class we pick wizard, as that fits Gandalf the best

**Ability score**
Then we decide his ability scores, this affects how charismatic, strong smart m.m he is. Using the point buy table shown earlier in the document we get the following stats.
Strength - 10
Dexterity - 8
Constitution - 10
Intelligence - 16
Wisdom - 14
Charisma - 12

Then because we made Gandalf a human he gets to add 1 to all ability scores. The scores will look as follows.
Strength - 11
Dexterity -9
Constitution - 11
Intelligence - 17
Wisdom - 15
Charisma - 13

  

**Background**
- For background we know that Gandalf studied and trained hard to become a wizard, therefore he might have the sage background. Being a sage makes Gandalf proficient in the skills arcana and History

**Equipment**
- Because of the class and background chosen we have a few options when determining what equipment Gandalf should have.
- For weapons we get to choose between a dagger or a quarterstaff and we will pick the quarterstaff.
- We then get to choose between a component pouch or an arcane focus where we will get the arcane focus
- Additionally Gandalf will get a spell book and a scholar's backpack

And then we have our finished character, Gandalf!
