Title: Races of Oran
---

There are quite a few races in the world of Oran

Far up above, on floating islands in the sky, live the [[Birb Race]].

A race split into two, the [[Humans]] live in the great desert, as well as in a floating city in the middle of the sea

Living in the caverns beneath a tiny island, the peak of a almost completely sunken mountain, are the [[Dwarves]]

At in the centre of the world, inside the dying great world tree, live the [[Elves]].

[[Tritons]] reside deep beneath the waves, in a great city at the bottom of the sea.
