Title: Tyrelle Elynnoor
---
### Description:
Tyrelle, or elle for short, is a young halfling with an apetite for gold. She generally has a braid and fancy earrings that change almost daily. Her favourite colour is green, and she almost wears something in that colour.

### About:
When she was young Elle travelled with [[Astrid]] and [[Philip Ravenloft]] for two years, and during that time she noticed that she had a nose for trade and commerce. She would always make sure that her adventuring party got the best deals possible, and when the party disbanded she decided to start a trading company with all the gold she had gotten. This went very well for her, and when [[Astrid|Astrid's]] call found her, she had a small trading empire set up, and was more than happy to expand into unknown territory.
