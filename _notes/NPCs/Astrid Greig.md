Title: Astrid Greig
---
### Description:
An older, rough and stout looking woman, clad in halfplate, always carrying a longsword at her side and a shield on her back.

### About:
Strict but fair, Astrid is a brave but wise adventurer, with the years of experience to prove it. She had just retired from adventuring, and was trying to figure out what to do with her life when she got a magical distress message. She found this message, about a mysterious land far away sinking into the ocean at an uprecedented pace, highly intruiguing, and wasted no time in rallying adventurers and tradespeople, sending letters and visiting all the contacts and friends she'd gotten over the years. Within only two and a half years, had she managed to source and secure enough materials, people and ships to attempt the voyage, and once they finally arrived, she set up the ever expanding floating city of [[Camp Tranquil]], and is currently running both the city and the adventurers' guild in it.
