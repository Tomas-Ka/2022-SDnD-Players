#### Played by: (Nicholas)
### Description:
Hey everyone, Justin here, writing up my introductions. I left my village to practice my craft and learn about the world, but then I drank a little too much in the harbour, fell asleep in the wrong boat, and now I'm here. Nothing against you folks, though! This place seems great. I'm an apothecary, so if any of y'all take a tumble, hit me up and I'll patch you up. Free of charge!

### Playstyle:
My plan is to keep you on your feet and in the thick of it! That being said, if any bugs need squashing, I've always got my trusty axe by my side.
