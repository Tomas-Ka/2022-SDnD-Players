Title: Pat the Rat
---
#### Played by: (Alma)
### Description:
Pat the Rat is a sneaky rat with a mysterious scar who is surprisingly charismatic and intimidating, though rather dumb. After its partner tragically died in a fire, he was very depresso espresso and lost their ability to play happy music. Even so, she joined a local cult as an entertainer for a while, and is now traveling around sowing chaos for the fun of it. Kobolds beware, for Pat the Rat only desires death to any and every Kobold. It likes to play sad music on his spork-shaped ukulele, collect bones, and must have at least one bone on herself at all times.

### Playstyle:
In a fight, they'll bonk you with his bat until you go splat, or just run if the enemy is too strong.
