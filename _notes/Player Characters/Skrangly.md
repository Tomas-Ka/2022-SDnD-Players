Title: Skrangly
---
#### Played by: (Kaeya)
### Description:
Skrangly is a knight that serves Leodero Elding (and is definitely not a simp) with a strange penchant for capturing Kobolds. He doesn't have any major aspirations, and is just content to serve. Quick to anger, but long to hold a grudge, anyone who crosses him will forever live in fear of being met with that flash of white fur or the twitch of his gray tail in the night before his spear marks their end.

### Playstyle:
He fights with a spear in close range, but can also throw javelins.
