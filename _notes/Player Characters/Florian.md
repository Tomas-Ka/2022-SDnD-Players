Title: Florian
---
#### Played by: (Elsa)
### Description:
Florian is irritable, but not short-tempered. He doesn't have anything against lying, but he prefers to bend the truth. He used to work as a priest. But when he got bored of the church he was working for, since he is not the most loyal person, he had no quams about becoming a warlock. That would allow him to do something opposite of his old job, adventure!

### Playstyle:
He prefers to attack from a distance, strategizing who's death would benefit his party the most. He doesn't use any weapons or his fists, only spells (Eldritch blast).
