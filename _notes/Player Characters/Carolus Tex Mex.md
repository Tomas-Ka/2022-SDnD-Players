Title: Carolus Tex Mex
---
#### Played by: (Axel)
### Description:
Carolus was born and raised in a temple. His life was devoted to religon and research until recently when he decided to part ways with the temple. After leaving the temple he came over a crossbow and learned how to use it.

### Playstyle:
Carolus is reluctant to fight unless there is a direct threat towards him. However, he enjoys the adrenaline rush he gets when he is in a fight. In the temple he had never felt anything like that and his old mentors would despise him for the way he felt.
