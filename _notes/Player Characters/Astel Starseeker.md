Title: Astel Starseeker
---
#### Played by: (Markus)
### Description:
Astel comes from a pacifistic nomad tribe of Githzerai that worships the stars. He is a calm person that uses logic and his wisdom to try to make the best decisions. While he may come from a peaceful tribe he won't hesitate to fight if he feels threatened. As he often is very calm and collected he does like to drink from time to time, but only in company he trusts.

### Playstyle:
He uses the celestial constellations to guide him through combat and casts spells at a range, rather than getting up close and personal because he sees the risk and does not like to bet his life on chance.
