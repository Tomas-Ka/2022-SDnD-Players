#### Played by: (Julian)
### Description:
Captain Rosa the Red Eyed is a ~~wannabe~~ pirate who longs for the greatest adventure possible! She loves everything about pirates, though she hasn’t actually met any and has just heard stories. She’s the captain of the Red Eyed Pirates, the “greatest” pirate crew in Oran!

Rosa is a Parrotin (Parrot Owlin) who hails from Macawlia, an island inhabited by Parrotins like herself. She left home and headed for Oran in order to pursue her dream to become a great pirate captain and to best and control the legendary Kraken! Rosa is a very cunning and arrogant person who overplays her own abilities a bit and it isn’t unknown for her to pick fights with people who she really shouldn’t pick a fight with.
