Title: Gibson Roland
---
#### Played by: (Emil)
### Description:
Gibson grew up poor, and aspired all his life to become a master of music. After a bit of searching they created a small duo with their friend [[Fender de Bussy|Fender]], and they now play music together. He is very weak, but is very outgoing and charismatic.

### Playstyle:
Gibson uses his confidence and music to generally avoid fights, as he is not particularly good. He can use spells, but was never really well taught on how to use them, so he tries not to. He does have a sling though, which he can use to peck at enemies from afar.
