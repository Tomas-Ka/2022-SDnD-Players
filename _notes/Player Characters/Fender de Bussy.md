Title: Fender de Bussy
---
#### Played by: (Pluto)
### Description:
Fender ran away from his Noble life to pursue music, and seek adventure. They got tired of sitting still and listening, with their charm, music and money he survived. He uses his family name in a clutch and brings shame to their family, but they donâ€™t care about that. He always brings his lute with him and is always up for a performance! Fender is 19 and a bit (quite a bit) chaotic and will do almost anything to get his way.

### Playstyle:
Fender fights with his charm and charisma, he will try to get out of fights with a bit of song or flirting. They have daggers but they mostly use them for eating food or cutting up something, very rarely for fights. Fender can use spells, in conclusion, they like to fight without getting their hands dirty.
