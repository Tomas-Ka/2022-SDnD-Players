##### Hello!
My name is Tomas, and I'm the current chairman of the DnD club, as well as the head DM. I've made this website to keep track of all our lore and other important documents, and to make sure that everything is in once central spot (I also personally think it looks prettier this way than in a Word Document, but that might just be me). In here is all lore for the DnD club at Spyken, along with all players and the reports written after successfull (or failed) quests.

### How?
This website is powered by Netlify, an online hosting service that lets you host webpages, as well as github. I'm using a modified version of a website template by Meewgumi, who in turn used a template from Maxime Vaillancourt.
